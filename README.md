# SeqMap

Use CI to test SeqMap 1.0.13 and mirror the source code stored at the Univ. of Michigan for research purposes only. (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jianghui/seqmap/)

# Reason why I do this
It seems many research articles only used the old version of SeqMap, albeit there's an updated version of it,
which is 1.0.13, this repository is created not only for the compilation test but also for the binary test.

~~21/09/2020 Update: Use Visual Studio 2017 to compile the code and generate binary which supports x64 on Windows.~~
# Please note:

~~g++-compiled binary might behave the way differently compared with the one compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.~~

~~Therefore it's highly experimental for using MSVC compiled seqmap.~~

The outputs generated by the binary which were compiled by MSVC or GCC are **equivalent**, the only reason that caused the difference of the output sizes is due to the difference of line break types between ```CR LF``` (Windows) and ```LF``` (Unix). The size of the file with the former one obviously would be larger than that with the latter one (if the content of these two files are absolutely identical). However, the content of these outputs are identical with each other, you may have to convert ```CR LF``` to ```LF``` if you want to process the output for the downstream analysis.

# To-do
~~fix the warnings prompted during the compilation of MSVC.~~
